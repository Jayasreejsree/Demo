# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project is designed to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing techniques. The code is written in Python and relies on several libraries and dependencies. This README file will guide you through the setup and execution of the code.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone 
2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd fake-news-detection
```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the code and detect fake news, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the project directory, and the virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python fake_news_detection.py
```

The script will load the model and perform fake news detection on a given text or dataset.

## Dataset

This project uses a labeled dataset of news articles. You can replace the dataset with your own if needed. The provided dataset is located in the `data` directory.

## Model

The code uses a pre-trained NLP model for fake news detection. You can find the model files in the `models` directory. If you wish to train your own model, you can do so by following the instructions in the `model_training` directory.

## Results

After running the code, you can find the detection results and metrics in the `results` directory.
